            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
            I am an aspiring full stack developer and a determined problem solver with 8 months of coding experience. I have a passion for building scalable web applications. Throughout my journey as a developer, I have gained proficiency in React, JavaScript, CSS, Node.js, MongoDB, and Express.js. I enjoy creating responsive and attractive layouts that enhance the user experience.
              <br />
              <br />
              Education-wise, I completed a Full Stack Web Development course at 10X Academy from July 2022 to May 2023. I also hold a B.Tech degree in Food Technology from K.K. Wagh College of Technology, Nashik.
              <br />

              Apart from my technical skills, I possess valuable soft skills such as being a team player, managing time effectively, and adapting to new situations. These skills have been instrumental in collaborating with teams and delivering successful projects.
